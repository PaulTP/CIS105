            <li>Cyber Security</li>
            <p>
                Cyber security analysts help to protect an organisation by employing a range of technologies and
                processes to prevent, detect and manage cyber threats.
                This can include protection of computers, data, networks and programmes.
                Broadly, you can work in one consulting, offering advisory services to clients, or
                working to protect the security of the organisation you work for.
                Job titles vary and may include information security analyst, security analyst, information security consultant,
                security operations centre (SOC) analyst and cyber intelligence analyst.

            <li>Data Analyst</li>
            <p>
                    Data analysts are in high demand across all sectors, such as finance, consulting,
                    manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, government and education.
                    The ability to pay attention to detail, communicate well and be highly organised are
                    essential skills for data analysts. They not only need to understand the data, but be
                    able to provide insight and analysis through clear visual, written and verbal communication.

            <li>Game Developer</li>
            <p>
                    Working in games development, you'll be involved in the creation
                    and production of games for personal computers, games consoles,
                    social/online games, arcade games, tablets, mobile phones and other
                    handheld devices.

                    The making of a game from concept to finished product can take years and
                    involve teams of professionals. There are several stages, including creating
                    and designing a game's look and how it plays, animating characters and objects,
                    creating audio, programming, localisation, testing, editing and producing.
            </p>
            <li>Machine Learning Engineer</li>
            <p>
                    As a machine learning engineer, working in this branch of artificial intelligence,
                    you'll be responsible for creating programmes and algorithms that enable machines to
                    take actions without being directed. An example of a system you may produce is a
                    self-driving car or a customised newsfeed.
                    A key feature of this work is that you're providing computers with the ability to
                    learn automatically and improve from experience, without being programmed.
            </p>
            <li>Software Engineer</li>
            <p>
                    As a software engineer, you'll work in a constantly evolving environment, due to
                    technological advances and the strategic direction of their organisation. You'll create,
                    maintain, audit and improve systems to meet particular needs, often as advised by a systems
                    analyst or architect, testing both hard and software systems to diagnose and resolve system faults.

                    The role also covers writing diagnostic programs and designing and writing code for operating
                    systems and software to ensure efficiency. When required, you'll make recommendations for
                    future developments.
